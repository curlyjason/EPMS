/**
 * Interface LayerTaskInterface
 *
 * I don't expect to need to implement this interface again. It was made to organize
 * my thoughts about division of labor for the LayerAccess system.
 *
 * These are the core tasks for LayerAccessProcessor. Esentially, the class needs to be
 * able to recieve all the data accessess and organization specifications (setArgObj())
 * and then process the data based on these specs (perform()).
 *
 * It needs to do all this in a fluent way (find()).
 *
 * Finally, because the system can be used in a step-wise/manual way (as well as fluent
 * style), it can cloneArgObj(). This feature is used to insure that once an LAP is
 * configured with it's LAA, it won't change when an external agent modifies its LAA
 * by reference.
