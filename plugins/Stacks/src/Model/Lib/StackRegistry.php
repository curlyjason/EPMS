/**
 * PersonCardRegistry
 *
 * PersonCards are frequently used objects and appear as properties of
 * several Stack types. This means that the same card may be needed in
 * more than one object during a single Request/Response cycle. In such
 * a case we need to insure all card data stays the same we will use this
 * registry to maintain singletons and pass along references.
 *
 * Registry operations are woven into the PersonCardsTable stack retrieval
 * processes. This makes use of this registry (and caching) automatic.
 * Just PersonCardsTable::find('stacksFor', [ ]) as you would for any
 * request and you'll get a singleton based reference back (or a set of them).
