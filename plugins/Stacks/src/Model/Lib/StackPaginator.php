	 * The reason: pagination must happen happen to a query that is
	 * created part way through stack assembly. Sending the pagination
	 * processes in as a callable allows it to be on the scene for this
	 * mid-stream use.
     *
     * Adjustments are made to the pagingParams.
     * Repository-keyed sets are converted to scope-keyed sets so that
     * multiple independent sets from a single Table are possible.
	 *
	 * @todo Does this method have to do any additional work to make
	 *		 $params and $settings work properly?
	 *
	 * @param Callable $findStackCallable
     * @param array $params Request params
     * @param array $settings The settings/configuration used for pagination.

         * Go through the stacks and paginate each of their layers as appropriate.
         *
         * We can add new paging blocks for each layer case. There is a question though:
         * when a user pages through a layer, do we let that layer in each stack page
         * in synch? or do we page each individually?
         * If done individually, we need a new scoped paging block for each or a
         * way to track the desired page in each layer somehow; stepping outside the
         * established request-param method.
         * example/index?index[page]=2&piece[page]=id55-2+id671-3
         * example/index?index[page]=2&layer[piece]=id55-2+id671-3
         * We'd have to modify the Pagination helper to create these new query args
         *
         * Looks like making a new query arg pattern would take study. But running
         * all the layers in synch will not work because they won't all have the same
         * number of pages. So, who would determine the correct settings for the block?
         *
         * It should not be hard to id the scopes and let each run independently. It just
         * means the url query params could grow long and the paging arrays in the
         * request would be large
         * example/index?index[page]=2&piece55[page]=2&piece671[page]=3
         * Additionally, if we use ajax to load page fragments, we'll have to write
         * js page update routines to fix any pagination tool blocks so they know the
         * new query args an don't restore some old page state when used.
